# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on preprocessing and analyzing housing data to build predictive models for house prices. The dataset contains various features such as location, square footage, heating type, and more. The goal is to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and develop machine learning models to predict house prices.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values.
   - Correcting errors in categorical and numerical data.
   - Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generating descriptive statistics.
   - Visualizing correlations and distributions.
   - Identifying trends and patterns in the data.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
   - Training models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest.
   - Hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest using GridSearchCV.

4. **Answering Questions**:
   - Identifying affordable houses within a budget.
   - Calculating potential savings by avoiding houses with pools.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.
  - `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for data visualization.
  - `sklearn` for machine learning models and evaluation.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the notebook `Data_preprocessing.ipynb` and execute the cells sequentially.

## Results
- The project provides insights into house prices based on various features.
- Predictive models are evaluated using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R2.

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional features for better predictions.
- Explore advanced machine learning models like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
